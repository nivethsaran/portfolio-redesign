I am a Creative Coder, Blogger and self-proclaimed Designer who specializes in web development.

In my swiss army knife of FullStack skills, React is my sharpest blade.

With over 2 years of experience in React, I've contributed to communities and startups alike, and so far, thankfully nothing has fallen apart.

From here on out, it's just Onwards and Upwards ðŸš€

On a more personal note, I spend my time working on my numerous [side projects](https://reubence.com/projects), contribute a little to open-source, and reach out to entrepreneurs on communities like [Indie Hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/reubence).

[Feel free to reach out](https://twitter.com/reuben_rapose) if you want to talk about work, technology or just geek out in general ðŸ¤“
