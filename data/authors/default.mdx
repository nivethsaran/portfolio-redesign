As a Software Engineer at Cisco Systems, I bring a versatile skill set to the table, with a penchant for automating tasks and a genuine enthusiasm for contributing to open source projects.

With over 2 years of hands-on experience, I've taken on diverse roles, including Scrum Lead and Partner Security Advocate, and have played pivotal roles in critical cross-functional projects.

Together, let's continue to push the boundaries and reach for new horizons! ðŸš€
